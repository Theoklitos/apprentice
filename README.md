Apprentice RPG(D20) Helper, This is a Java Swing desktop application meant to help dungeon masters manage the burden 
of maintaining up-to-date player character (PC) information.


Desktop Application
-------------------
The swing application has been tested on Unix (Debian, Ubuntu) and Mac. The db4o database it requires is auto-initialized and everything should work with no extra setup.

Due to problems with getting gradle to generate a .jar file, the only way to start the application is to import the project and run the main methon in StartupApplication.java.
